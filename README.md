Font-Facer
==========

A  python script that generates a webpage for testing text in font-face kits.

It is intended to work with fonts generated by Font Squirrels [font-face generator][fsg] ( or downloaded  [font-face kits] [fsk] )

Usage
=====
Assuming the `python` executable is on your system path, just run the following:

	python font-facer.py [ /path/to/your/font-face/directory ]
	
This will create a file `font-facer.html` containing all the font-faces in the target directory,  in which text content can be be tested.
